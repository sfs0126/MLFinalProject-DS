NCF Machine Learning Final Project - Art Classification using NN and Random Forest in R

Project Proposal:

Pick an interesting data set.
https://www.kaggle.com/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving?select=dataset

Ask a question about it appropriate for supervised learning.
Can we classify art types/mediums using image classification?

Clear the data set and question(s) with me.

Finalize data set and model by Tuesday, April 13.
(You may do some unsupervised learning.)

Apply a neural net model plus at least one other model for comparison.
We will use a nueral net (CNN) and decision trees (Random Forest) models on our training set for comparison and test on the best preforming model. 

Present your results to me and the class during the last week of classes. Presentations are 20 minutes, or 15 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions.
