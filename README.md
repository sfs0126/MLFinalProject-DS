Project Proposal:

Pick an interesting data set.
Ask a question about it appropriate for supervised learning.
Clear the data set and question(s) with me.
Finalize data set and model by Tuesday, April 13.
(You may do some unsupervised learning.)
Apply a neural net model plus at least one other model for comparison.
Present your results to me and the class during the last week of classes. Presentations are 20 minutes, or 15 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions.
